<span class="count"> 1) </span>	<b> Lack of awareness amongst the students and corporates: </b> Since the B.Voc course is a newly launched degree program, hence students as well as corporates are unfamiliar with it. Since not much awareness is created about this course, not many companies recruit the students for internships and placements. This might lead to closure/shut down of this course in the long run.  <br> <br>                       
<span class="count">  2) </span> <b>  Challenging administrative work:  </b>Coordinating with the Guest Faculty teachers for administrative task or organizing an event is quite challenging.<br><br>    
<span class="count">  3) </span> <b> Correction of certificates issued from  NASSCOM and BFSI end:</b>  Inspite of providing the students details to the NASSCOM authorities repeatedly, there is either an error in the students name or in their fatherâ€™s name. This is making the distribution of certificates a time consuming process.
